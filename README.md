# example-problems
Here I store solutions to example problems I solved, written in multiple programming languages.

The purpose of these examples is to show my knowledge of programming in C++ and Python. For more complicated projects, please see my other repositories. 
Unfortunately, some names of variables or functions can contain Polish words, but the general purpose of the code should be easy to understand from the scripts.
